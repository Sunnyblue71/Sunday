# Sunday Aghamie — Applied (Bio)Statistics

Welcome! This repository hosts **sample analyses**, **reproducible workflows**, and **teaching materials** that reflect my work in **Applied Statistics & Biostatistics**, including modern statistical learning and survival modeling.

## About
I am an **Applied & (Bio)-Statistician** and **Ph.D. candidate (Applied Statistics & Research Methods)** with research interests in:
- **Bayesian and deep survival modeling** (e.g., IPCW, DeepSurv / Bayesian Neural Mixture ideas)
- **Uncertainty quantification** and **model calibration**
- **High-dimensional predictive modeling** for clinical/public-health and other applied datasets
- **Multivariate analysis** and applied ML

## Highlights
- **Reproducible analysis templates** (R/Quarto, R Markdown)
- **Survival analysis examples** (Cox, IPCW, ML-based survival)
- **Applied modeling workflows**: study design, statistical analysis plans, model validation, reporting
- **Teaching materials**: data cleaning, visualization, regression, inference, and interpretation

## Awards & Honors
- Best Graduating Student, School of Sciences, College of Education, Agbor, Delta State, Nigeria (1992)
- Best Graduating Student in Mathematics, College of Education, Agbor, Delta State, Nigeria (1992)
- Best Graduating Student in Chemistry, College of Education, Agbor, Delta State, Nigeria (1992)
- Best Graduating Student in Integrated Science, College of Education, Agbor, Delta State, Nigeria (1992)

## Teaching & Mentoring (Data Analysis Experience)
My teaching and training experience includes **hands-on instruction in introductory statistical analysis and applied data methods**, with emphasis on:
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Regression and inference (interpretation-first)
- Reproducible reporting (R Markdown / Quarto)
- Guiding students through projects, assumptions, diagnostics, and communication of results

## Selected Project Topics (Examples)
- Decision-tree–based model comparison for **forest fire prediction**
- **SVM-based breast tumor classification** project report
- Multivariate ML modeling for **environmental quality** prediction
- **PCA-based classification** on wine chemistry data

## Tools & Stack
- **Programming:** Python, R, SAS  
- **Bayesian software:** WinBUGS, OpenBUGS  
- **ML libraries:** PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- **Other:** LaTeX, SPSS, Minitab
